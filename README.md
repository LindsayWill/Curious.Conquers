##Data Science 
Final Project on Crime
Executive Summary
We were given the last 6 weeks of our Data Science program to work on our final project. We chose to work on reports on Crime. Working with 4 people in total, we were required to collaborate on data analysis. This document is to explain the scope of our project.
Business Objectives
Our business objective is to use our recently acquired skills in Python and R. We will be showing off Machine Learning and Data Wrangling in Python of crime reports data from 2016. Displaying analytics in R and visualizations in Tableau. At the end of the project Mischa, Alisha, Lisa and Lindsay should be able to work together to display their work in a way that is understood by faculty,  fellow students and potential employers. 
Background
With Alisha being an emergency dispatcher, we felt that doing our final project on crime within Texas and the differences in divisions. Showcasing our practical knowledge of what we have learned over the entirety of our Wozu course. With help from this data set we should be able to identify differences between the arrest’s procedures within the divisions.
Scope
Mischa, Alisha, Lisa and Lindsay will be using software taught throughout their lessons. Express data using tools that we found fun and interesting, as well as tools that may be found functional in future potential careers.
Functional requirements
Plan proposal is where we took questions, got to know our team and set up required collaboration software, such as Trello, Google forms, Github. Data wrangling within Python. Exploratory analysis is where we brainstormed the question for the dataset and identified models to make predictions. Data analysis we compared the value of measurements and understanding of columns and rows within the data set. Data visualization is used to make the data to comply visuals like maps and graphs, Presentation is to show off our visualizations and text findings through a Zoom presentation.
Personnel requirements
Our team consists of four members, Mischa, Alisha, Lisa and Lindsay. All working together as Data Scientist through Zoom, Github and Slack to collaborate. We took turns being scrub masters to review our weekly work and report it to our instructor (Product Owner) on the progress we made.  We can also consult with our mentor for further questions.
Delivery schedule
Week 1 Plan proposal is where we took questions, got to know our team and set up required collaboration software, such as Trello, Google forms, Github.
 Week 2 Data wrangling within Python. 
Week 3 Exploratory analysis is where we brainstormed the question for the dataset and identified models to make predictions. 
Week 4 Data analysis we compared the value of measurements and understanding of columns and rows within the data set. 
Week 5 Data visualization is used to make the data to comply visuals like maps and graphs, 
Week 6 Presentation is to show off our visualizations and text findings through a Zoom PowerPoint presentation. 
Other requirements
It should be free of charge; advance service charge is optional. 
Assumptions
Everyone on the team is available. If the Software programs are functioning. Technology is all working accordingly. No emergencies. 
Limitations
Pre-existing data usage may limit our results on a working analysis. Help with error messages may be delayed if can’t meet with instructor or mentor within a timely manner.
Risks
Even though risks are low, there are still chances for broken hardware or software, natural disaster, and family emergency. We are going to succeed in finishing this project with high remarks.
